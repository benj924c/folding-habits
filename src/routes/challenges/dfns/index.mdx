# The DFNS challege

## WHat is it?

The DFNS challenge is pushing yourself to the extreme and endure wathcing the same movie over and over again
in your target language. The challenge is named after the Australian Youtuber Lemont who goes by DFNS on Youtube.
He himself made this challenge to improve his Spanish in particular but also to test how effective it would be to engage in familiar content.
He highly recommends this challenge to anyone who wants to improve their language skills. And now you can take part in this challenge
here on Folding Habits and track your progress towards the end goal.

## Hardships
According to Lemont the first 7-8 times watching the movie was the toughest as this felt the most repetitive.
